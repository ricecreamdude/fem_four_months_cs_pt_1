Reddit Interview Question

I give you two sorted arrays,
How do find the median element of these two array values? (Find the middle number)

[1,5,8,9]
[2,3,7,10]

Solution 1.
Concatenate both arrays and find the middle value
  - Uses too much processing power to solve

Solution 2.
Use a merge function (the stitch function from Merge Sort exercise) and find the middle value
  - Better than solution 1 but still uses a little too much data

Solution 3.
Use the merge function and count 5 values into the sort function
